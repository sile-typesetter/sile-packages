# deprecated

This repository is deprecated.
It contained an index of packages available for use by the internal package manager used in SILE v0.12 and before.
Since SILE v0.13 the package system has been completely overhauled.

Packages can now easily provide modules of any type (including but not limited to classes, inputters, etc.).
They are can also be distributed easily as Lua Rocks.

Please see current SILE documentation for more information on modern packages.
